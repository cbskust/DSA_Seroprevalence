# Seroprevalene.Vaccination
This repository provides scripts to perform modeling of prevalence and incidence using individual seroprevalence information of COVID-19 test and sewershed in Jefferson County, Kentucky. 

The repository constitutes two parts; Dynamics Survival Analysis (DSA) of individual-level data and Bayesian generalized linear model (GLM) fitting SARS-CoV-2 viral RNS concentration in wastewater facilities with estimated prevalence according to the simulation of vaccination status or delta variant mutation status. 

The code was tested on MacBo Pro(2017) running Mac OS X Montery (12.5.1), with processor 2.3 GHz 18-Core Xeon W under R studio version 2022.07.0, with R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23) and rstan library version 2.21.2.
