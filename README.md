# Seroprevalene.Vaccination
This software (code) provides scripts to perform modeling of prevalence and incidence using individual seroprevalence information of COVID-19 test and sewershed in Jefferson County, Kentucky, and perform a statistical model to identify the relationship between predicted prevalence or incidence and observed concentration of COVID-19 in the wastewater. 

The code constitutes two parts; Dynamics Survival Analysis (DSA) of individual-level data and Bayesian generalized linear model (GLM) fitting SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA concentration in wastewater facilities with estimated prevalence according to the simulation of vaccination status or delta variant mutation status.

The code was tested on MacBook Pro(2023) running Mac OS X Ventura (13.6.4), with processor M2 Pro 3.504 GHz 10-Core  under R studio version 2023.12.1, with R version 4.3.2 (2023-10-31) and Tristan library version 2.21.2.
